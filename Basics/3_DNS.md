Let‚Äôs look at **DNS (Domain Name System)** from a **system design** perspective‚Äîhow it fits into distributed systems, scalability, high availability, and user experience.

## üåê What is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the **‚Äúphonebook‚Äù** of the internet. It translates **human-readable domain names** (like `example.com`) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (like `192.0.2.1`) so systems can find each other.

## üß© DNS in System Design: Why It Matters

### 1. **Decouples Clients from Infrastructure**

Instead of exposing hard-coded IP addresses, services are accessed via domain names. This enables:

* Flexibility in infrastructure changes
* Use of **load balancers**, **CDNs**, or **multi-region deployments**

üß† Example: `api.example.com` might point to a load balancer today, but tomorrow it could route to a different server or region.

---

### 2. **Load Balancing with DNS**

* **DNS Round Robin**: One domain resolves to multiple IPs.

  ```
  app.example.com ‚Üí [192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2, 192.0.2.3]
  ```

  DNS servers rotate IPs to distribute traffic (though not evenly).

* Combined with load balancers (like AWS ELB), DNS helps route traffic dynamically.

---

### 3. **High Availability & Failover**

* **Health checks** can be used to detect unhealthy endpoints.
* DNS can switch traffic to a backup IP or region if a primary one fails.
* Services like **Route 53**, **Cloudflare**, and **NS1** support **geo-DNS**, **latency-based routing**, and **failover routing**.

---

### 4. **Scalability and Caching**

* DNS responses are cached (locally by the OS/browser or by ISPs) using **TTL (Time-To-Live)**.
* Short TTL = more agility (faster updates), but more load on DNS.
* Long TTL = better performance, but slower to adapt to infrastructure changes.

---

### 5. **Microservices and Internal DNS**

In a microservices architecture:

* Services often talk to each other using **service discovery** via internal DNS.
* Example: `auth-service.internal`, `db-service.internal`

In Kubernetes:

* Services are exposed using names like `service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`.

## üìä How DNS Fits Into a Typical Web Request

```text
User types "www.example.com"
        ‚Üì
Browser checks DNS cache
        ‚Üì
If not found, asks OS
        ‚Üì
If still not found, queries DNS resolver (ISP or Google 8.8.8.8)
        ‚Üì
Resolver finds IP from authoritative DNS server
        ‚Üì
Returns IP (e.g., 203.0.113.42)
        ‚Üì
Browser connects to that IP to fetch the webpage
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Key DNS Design Patterns

| Pattern               | Use Case                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| DNS Round Robin       | Simple load distribution          |
| GeoDNS                | Route based on user location      |
| Latency-based routing | Route to nearest/fastest region   |
| Failover routing      | Switch traffic during outages     |
| TTL Tuning            | Balance between caching & agility |
