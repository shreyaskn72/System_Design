Let’s break down **HTTP** and **HTTPS** in the context of **system design**, especially as they relate to communication between clients and servers in web-based architectures.

## 🌐 What is HTTP/HTTPS?

### 📡 **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

* A **stateless**, **text-based protocol** used for transferring data (HTML, JSON, files) between clients (browsers, mobile apps) and servers.
* Operates over **port 80** by default.
* No encryption — data is sent in **plain text**.

### 🔐 **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**

* The **secure version of HTTP**.
* Uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to encrypt the data in transit.
* Operates over **port 443** by default.
* Prevents **eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks**, and **data tampering**.

## 🏗️ HTTP/HTTPS in System Design: Why It Matters

### 1. **Client-Server Communication**

* All REST APIs and browser-server interactions rely on **HTTP/HTTPS**.
* Defines **request methods**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
* Defines **status codes**: `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`.

---

### 2. **Security (HTTPS is Essential)**

* All modern systems **must** use HTTPS to:

  * Protect user data (especially in login/payment flows)
  * Gain trust (SSL certificate validation)
  * Avoid browser warnings (e.g., Chrome blocks non-HTTPS logins)

**In system design, HTTPS is non-negotiable.**

---

### 3. **Performance with HTTPS**

* Modern TLS versions are **fast and optimized**.
* Enables **HTTP/2** (multiplexed connections, better performance).
* Can be combined with:

  * **CDNs** (e.g., Cloudflare)
  * **Caching headers**
  * **Compression (gzip, Brotli)**

---

### 4. **TLS Termination**

* Done at a **reverse proxy** or **load balancer** to offload decryption from backend servers.

```text
Client (HTTPS) 
     ↓
[ Reverse Proxy / Load Balancer ]
     ↓ (HTTP inside network)
Backend Servers
```

---

### 5. **Authentication & Cookies**

* **Cookies** and **tokens** (JWT, sessions) are passed in **HTTP headers**.
* Use `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags with cookies in HTTPS-only systems.
* HTTP headers also carry:

  * Authorization tokens
  * API keys
  * Rate-limiting metadata

---

### 6. **Idempotency and Safe Methods**

* **GET**: Safe and idempotent (should not change state).
* **POST**: Not idempotent (used to create resources).
* **PUT**/**DELETE**: Idempotent (update/delete operations).

Understanding this is critical for **API design and reliability**.

## 📊 Summary Table

| Feature     | HTTP                    | HTTPS                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Port        | 80                      | 443                      |
| Encryption  | ❌ None                  | ✅ TLS (Secure)           |
| Use Case    | Legacy/internal systems | ✅ Modern, secure systems |
| SEO/Ranking | ❌ Not preferred         | ✅ Google prefers it      |
| User Trust  | ❌ Browser warnings      | ✅ Padlock in URL bar     |

### 🛠️ Design Tip

Always design public-facing systems to:

* Use **HTTPS by default**
* Redirect **HTTP → HTTPS**
* Support **TLS 1.2+**
* Terminate TLS at edge (load balancers/CDNs) for performance
