**Latency** is a fundamental concept in **system design**, especially for building fast, scalable, and user-friendly systems. Let’s explore it in detail:

## 🕒 What is Latency?

**Latency** is the **time delay** between a request and the corresponding response. In system design, it measures **how fast** your system can respond to user actions or data processing.

### 🔍 Example:

If a user clicks a button on a web app and it takes 1.5 seconds to display the result, that’s 1.5 seconds of latency.

## ⏱️ Types of Latency in System Design

### 1. **Network Latency**

* Time taken for data to travel across the network from client → server → client.
* Affected by:

  * Physical distance (e.g., New York → Tokyo)
  * Network congestion
  * Number of hops (routers, proxies)

### 2. **Application Latency**

* Time taken by your app’s backend to process a request.
* Includes:

  * Business logic execution
  * API response generation

### 3. **Database Latency**

* Time spent reading from or writing to the database.
* Can be impacted by:

  * Query complexity
  * Indexing
  * Lock contention
  * Replication lag

### 4. **Disk/IO Latency**

* Time to read/write data from storage (especially relevant for file systems, logs, caching layers).

### 5. **Frontend Latency**

* Time the browser/app takes to render the UI.
* Includes:

  * Parsing HTML/JS
  * Image loading
  * Client-side processing

## 📐 Latency Metrics

| Metric       | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| P50 (Median) | 50% of requests are faster than this    |
| P95 / P99    | Tail latency — 5% / 1% slowest requests |
| Average      | Can be misleading due to outliers       |
| Max          | Worst case latency (for debugging)      |

## ⚙️ Latency in Architecture: Where It Hits

```text
Client Request
    ↓
Frontend Rendering
    ↓
Network Latency
    ↓
Reverse Proxy / Load Balancer
    ↓
Backend Logic Execution
    ↓
Database Query
    ↓
External API Calls (if any)
    ↓
Response back to Client
```

Each layer adds **some latency**.

## 🔧 Techniques to Reduce Latency

| Area            | Optimization Techniques                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**     | CDNs, edge servers, keep-alive connections        |
| **Backend**     | Efficient code, async processing, thread pools    |
| **Database**    | Indexing, caching, denormalization, read replicas |
| **Frontend**    | Lazy loading, bundling, minifying assets          |
| **Caching**     | Use Redis/Memcached for frequent data             |
| **Geolocation** | Route users to nearest data center/region         |

## 📉 Why Latency Matters

* **User Experience**: Every 100ms delay can reduce user engagement.
* **Scalability**: High latency often signals a bottleneck.
* **SLAs**: Systems need to meet uptime and performance guarantees.
* **Cost**: Reducing latency can lower resource usage (e.g., less CPU per request).

### 🚦 Summary

Latency is:

* The delay from request to response.
* Comes from many layers: network, code, database, etc.
* Needs to be monitored, measured (P95/P99), and actively optimized.
