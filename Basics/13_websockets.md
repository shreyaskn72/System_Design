Let's break down **WebSockets** from a **system design perspective**, especially in contrast to traditional HTTP communication, and see how they fit into modern, scalable architectures.

## üîç What are WebSockets?

**WebSockets** provide a **full-duplex**, **persistent** communication channel over a single TCP connection between the client and server. This means both parties can **send and receive data at any time**, unlike HTTP, which is strictly request-response based.

WebSockets are ideal for **real-time, bi-directional communication**, such as:

* Live chat applications
* Online multiplayer games
* Real-time analytics dashboards
* Collaborative tools (e.g. Google Docs-like editors)
* Financial trading platforms

## üß± WebSockets vs HTTP (in System Design)

| Feature              | HTTP                                           | WebSockets                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Communication        | Request-response only                          | Full-duplex, both client and server can send data |
| Connection type      | New connection for each request                | Long-lived, persistent connection                 |
| Latency              | Higher (more handshakes, headers)              | Lower (no repeated handshakes)                    |
| Overhead             | Higher (with headers, repeated TCP handshakes) | Lower (persistent socket)                         |
| Real-time capability | Limited (requires polling or long-polling)     | Native, real-time updates                         |

## üèóÔ∏è WebSockets in System Architecture

### Typical WebSocket Flow:

```text
[Client Browser/App]
        ‚áÖ  WebSocket
 [WebSocket Server Layer]
        ‚áÖ
 [Business Logic / Microservices]
        ‚áÖ
    [Database / PubSub / Cache]
```

* **Client** opens a WebSocket connection.
* The server accepts and maintains a persistent connection.
* The client and server can now **push messages to each other** as needed.

---

## üîß System Design Considerations with WebSockets

### 1. **Connection Management**

* A WebSocket connection remains open until explicitly closed.
* Need to track and manage active connections efficiently.
* At scale, you may handle **thousands to millions of concurrent connections**.

### 2. **Horizontal Scaling**

* WebSockets don‚Äôt naturally work well with stateless, horizontally scaled servers.
* Use a **shared state** or **central messaging broker** to coordinate messages across instances.

‚úÖ Solution: Use a **message broker** like **Redis Pub/Sub**, **Kafka**, or **NATS** to broadcast messages between nodes.

```text
          Clients
             ‚Üì
  ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
  ‚îÇ WS Server 1‚îÇ WS Server 2‚îÇ  ‚Üê Each maintains its own WebSocket connections
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
       ‚Üì            ‚Üì
     [ Redis Pub/Sub / Kafka / NATS ]
```

### 3. **Authentication**

* WebSocket handshakes occur via HTTP initially.
* Use tokens (e.g. JWT) during handshake for auth.
* Once established, implement **authorization** per message or session.

### 4. **Resilience & Reconnection**

* Network failures can cause connection drops.
* Clients should implement **reconnect logic** and resume interrupted sessions.

### 5. **Message Protocol**

* Decide how messages are structured:

  * JSON (easier to debug, larger payload)
  * Binary (smaller, faster, but harder to inspect)
* You may define your own message types (e.g., `chat_message`, `user_typing`, `notification_ack`)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security in WebSockets

| Threat                    | Mitigation                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Man-in-the-middle attacks | Use **WSS** (WebSocket over TLS)                        |
| Unauthorized access       | Authenticate via token in handshake (JWT, OAuth2)       |
| Message tampering         | Sign/encrypt sensitive data, validate message structure |
| Flooding/DOS              | Rate-limit connections and messages                     |

## üì¶ Common Use Case in Microservices

### Real-Time Chat App Example:

```text
[Browser Client]
     ‚áÖ WebSocket
[Chat Gateway Service] ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Redis Pub/Sub
                     ‚áµ          ‚áµ
             [User Service]  [Message Service]
```

* The **Chat Gateway** maintains the WebSocket connections.
* When a message is received, it publishes to Redis.
* Other services (e.g., analytics, notifications) can subscribe to Redis and react accordingly.

---

## üìà When to Use WebSockets in System Design

### ‚úÖ Great For:

* Real-time applications: chat, games, stock tickers
* Push notifications: e.g., order updates, live status
* Collaborative tools: live document editing, cursors
* Low-latency interactions (e.g., live GPS tracking)

### ‚ùå Not Ideal For:

* Simple CRUD APIs
* Systems where polling is sufficient and connections are sparse
* Environments with strict firewall/proxy restrictions (WebSockets can be blocked more easily than HTTP)

## üîÑ Alternatives to WebSockets

| Alternative                  | Use Case                                     | Limitations                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP Polling**             | Simple systems, rarely updated data          | High latency, inefficient                   |
| **Long Polling**             | Near-real-time without WebSockets            | Complex server-side logic, delays           |
| **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** | One-way real-time updates from server        | No client-to-server messaging               |
| **gRPC Streaming**           | Real-time, efficient, multi-language systems | More complex, not natively browser-friendly |
