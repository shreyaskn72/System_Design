Let’s break down **Proxy** and **Reverse Proxy** in the context of **system design**, particularly focusing on scalability, security, performance, and architecture best practices.

---

## 🧭 What Is a Proxy?

A **proxy server** is an intermediary between a client and another server. Depending on its direction, it can be:

### 🔁 Forward Proxy (Client-side Proxy)

* Sits **in front of the client**.
* Sends requests on behalf of the client to the target server.
* Hides the client’s identity from the server.

**Use Cases:**

* Privacy/anonymity
* Content filtering (e.g. in corporate networks)
* Caching requests for performance
* Enforcing access control policies

```text
Client → Forward Proxy → Internet (Server)
```

---

## 🔄 Reverse Proxy (Server-side Proxy)

A **reverse proxy** sits **in front of backend servers** and handles requests **on behalf of the server**.

**Client → Reverse Proxy → Backend Server(s)**

It hides backend details and provides a unified access point.

---

## 🔧 Use Cases for Reverse Proxy in System Design

### 1. **Load Balancing**

Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to prevent overload.

```text
Client → Reverse Proxy → [Server A, Server B, Server C]
```

Tools: **Nginx**, **HAProxy**, **Envoy**, **AWS ELB**

---

### 2. **Security & Anonymization**

* Hides internal server IPs from the public.
* Acts as a gatekeeper for authentication, SSL termination, etc.
* Protects from direct attacks (e.g., DDoS).

---

### 3. **SSL Termination**

Offloads the expensive task of decrypting HTTPS traffic at the proxy level.

```text
Client (HTTPS) → Reverse Proxy (decrypts SSL) → Backend (HTTP)
```

---

### 4. **Caching**

Stores responses to reduce repeated backend processing and latency.

Example: Caching static assets, API responses.

---

### 5. **Compression**

Proxies can compress data before sending it to the client, improving performance.

---

### 6. **Routing / URL Rewriting**

* Reverse proxies can route traffic to different services based on path or domain.

```text
/api → API server  
/web → Web server  
/media → Media server
```

## 🧱 Real-World Example Architecture

```text
               ┌────────────┐
               │   Client   │
               └────┬───────┘
                    │
             ┌──────▼───────┐
             │ Reverse Proxy│ (e.g. Nginx)
             └────┬──┬──────┘
       ┌──────────┘  └────────────┐
       ▼                         ▼
 ┌────────────┐         ┌────────────┐
 │ App Server │         │ API Server │
 └────────────┘         └────────────┘
```
