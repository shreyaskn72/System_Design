Let’s break down **Client-Server Architecture** in the context of **system design**:

### 🚦 What is Client-Server Architecture?

**Client-Server Architecture** is a model where two types of systems interact:

* **Client:** Requests data or services.
* **Server:** Responds with the requested data or service.

This model is foundational in most modern applications, from web browsers talking to websites to mobile apps accessing backend APIs.

### 🏗️ Components in System Design Context

1. **Client (Frontend)**

   * This could be a browser, mobile app, desktop software, etc.
   * It sends requests (e.g., HTTP requests) to the server.
   * Often stateless – it doesn't store user session info unless locally cached.

2. **Server (Backend)**

   * Receives and processes client requests.
   * Handles business logic, authentication, database operations, etc.
   * Typically a **web server** or **application server**.
   * May scale horizontally to handle more requests (i.e., more server instances).

3. **Database**

   * Stores and retrieves data for the server.
   * The server is the only one interacting with the database directly (clients don’t access it).

4. **Network/Internet**

   * The medium that connects clients and servers (usually via HTTP/S).
   * Often involves **load balancers**, **firewalls**, and **gateways**.

### 📊 High-Level Flow

```text
Client (browser/app)
        |
        v
    Load Balancer
        |
        v
   Application Server
        |
        v
     Database
```

**Example**: When you open Facebook:

* Your browser (client) sends a request to Facebook's servers.
* A load balancer directs your request to a suitable backend server.
* The server processes the request, fetches data from a database, and returns a web page or JSON.
* The client displays the content to the user.

---

### ⚖️ Benefits

* **Modularity** – Clients and servers can evolve independently.
* **Scalability** – Easy to scale server side (add more backend servers).
* **Security** – Sensitive data and logic are kept on the server.
* **Maintainability** – Easier to update and patch server logic centrally.

---

### 🚧 Challenges

* **Latency** – Network delays can impact performance.
* **Concurrency** – Servers must handle many simultaneous client requests.
* **Failure Handling** – Need strategies for server crashes or network issues.
