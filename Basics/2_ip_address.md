Let‚Äôs explore **IP Address** from a **system design** perspective, focusing on how it plays a role in communication, routing, scaling, and reliability of distributed systems.

## üåê What is an IP Address?

An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network. It allows systems to **locate and communicate** with each other.

There are two versions:

* **IPv4**: `192.168.1.1` (32-bit)
* **IPv6**: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334` (128-bit, more addresses)

---

## üîß Role of IP Address in System Design

### 1. **Communication Between Clients and Servers**

Every **client request** must know the IP address of the **server** it‚Äôs trying to reach. This could be:

* A **public IP** (e.g., connecting to `google.com`)
* A **private IP** (within internal networks)

üß† Example: When a user accesses a website, DNS resolves `example.com` ‚Üí `192.0.2.1`, and the browser connects to that IP.

---

### 2. **Load Balancing**

* Load balancers have a **public IP**.
* Internally route traffic to multiple **private IPs** of backend servers.
* Helps distribute traffic evenly.

```text
Client --> [Load Balancer: 52.10.10.1] --> [Server 1: 10.0.1.1]
                                          --> [Server 2: 10.0.1.2]
```

### 3. **Scalability**

* Cloud systems often use **auto-scaling** where new servers are assigned **dynamic IPs**.
* Use **Elastic IPs** or **DNS records** (e.g., in AWS) to point to the right instance regardless of the changing IP.

---

### 4. **Routing & Subnetting**

* IP addresses help in **network segmentation**.
* Subnetting allows grouping servers logically (e.g., `10.0.1.x` for web servers, `10.0.2.x` for databases).

---

### 5. **Security Design**

* **Firewall rules** use IPs to allow/block traffic.
* You can configure:

  * IP whitelisting
  * Geo-blocking
  * VPN tunneling with specific IP ranges

---

### 6. **Redundancy & Failover**

* Use **multiple IPs** for redundancy (e.g., DNS with multiple A records).
* If one server fails, traffic reroutes to another IP (failover mechanism).

---

### üîê Real-World Example: AWS EC2

* Each EC2 instance has:

  * **Private IP** (internal communication)
  * **Public IP** (external access)
  * Optional **Elastic IP** (static public IP)

This setup is crucial for both **designing scalable architectures** and maintaining **high availability**.
